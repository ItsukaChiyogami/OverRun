# Description
Overrun Game is an idle runner game that combines classic mechanics, such as the Chrome Dinosaur Runner, with body motion-based technology. Players use a camera to control the character through physical movements, offering a unique and interactive gaming experience.

# Key Features
- Camera-Based Gameplay: Control the character by jumping, crouching, or moving sideways using body gestures.
- Dynamic Idle Runner: The character automatically moves forward while players avoid obstacles with responsive body movements.
- Suitable for All Ages: Easy to play for everyone, yet fun and challenging.
- Engaging Physical Activity: Play while staying active for a healthy and fun experience.

# How to Play
1. Set Up Your Camera: Make sure your device's camera is active and working correctly to detect your body movements.
2. Main Detected Movements:

   - Crouch: Duck to pass under tall obstacles (e.g., tree trunks or planks).
